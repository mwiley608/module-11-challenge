Bootcamp Module 11 Challenge
This project was created as a homework assignment to complete web-scraping and analyze the resulting data. The main scripts are locatined in two Jupyter Notebook files. The part 1 .ipynb file scrapes Mars news articlesâ€™ titles and preview text. The part 2 .ipynb file scrapes a table with Mars weather data and then analyses the scraped data, including average temperatures and pressure.  The resulting outputs from the script can be found in the Project_Output folder, including the json file from part 1 and the three plots and the csv file from part 2.

The data for this project was scraped from the following websites: 
https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html
https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html

I used the two files contained in the Starter_Code folder as a starting point for my Jupyter Notebooks. 

I used the webpage https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59327547/write-a-json-file-from-list to help write the code to save to a json file in part 1.

I used the webpage https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/add-column-names-to-dataframe-in-pandas/ to review how to write the code to add column headers to the DataFrame in part 2. 

I used the webpage https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-pandas-to_datetime/ to determine the correct label for a datetime datatype to use in the datatype conversion in part 2.
